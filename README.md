You may categorize the inventory based on priority or based on certain criteria such as finished goods, ordering, goods need to order and other criteria that suitable based on the organization nature that you are focusing on for the system. Your system needs to alert or highlight the goods that need to be ordered. Goods that are less than 5 items should be highlighted or prompted by the system to order from the vendor. Every sales of the item need to be auto deducted from the inventory system.  You are free to design the system based on your creativity in terms of interface design and system functionality.
